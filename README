This is a test runner binary, it works on filename conventions. It's backed by mocha. 

    npm install dry-test

    # dry-test

The binary will pickup all files names *.test.js and *.test.tjs in your current working tree. It ignores node_modules on the file tree walk. It will compile the .tjs (tamejs) files to hidden files, ie .*.test.tjs in the same path as the original file.  It will then pass all the files to mocha to test.

It does a walk of the file system every time, so I imagine it runs pretty slow with a bunch of test files on a conventional HD. If you do builds of anything, buy an SSD. Seriously.

I need to add some configuration support for mocha, right now it runs with qunit style tests and the dot reporter. 

TODO: Add a shell script that I pass the file names to, and shell out to that in the node script, so mocha can be easily user configured.
